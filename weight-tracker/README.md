# Weight Tracker

I have an excel sheet to track weight.
I want to create a react app to use instead.
Learn react and lose weight: right on!

## Current todo

- Render list of weights in context of one week
- We should show empty entries
- Fetch entries for week number
- Idea: Collapsible header with Week info
